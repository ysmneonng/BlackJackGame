# BlackJackGame
A Blackjack Game Exercising Some Skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

This is a browser-based Blackjack game built to strengthen my front-end development skills. It features a clean user interface designed with HTML and CSS, and dynamic gameplay logic implemented using vanilla JavaScript. The project includes card drawing, score calculation, basic game rules, and interactive UI feedback. Great for practicing DOM manipulation and event handling!
